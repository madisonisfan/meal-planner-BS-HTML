# Meal Planner - Bootstrap

In 2021 I participated in Nucamp's Full-Stack Bootcamp. In the first phase, we reviewed HTML and were taught how to design and build fully responsive websites with the Bootstrap framework. To enhance my learning of new topics, I created this simple meal-planning website built just with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
