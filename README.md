# Meal Planner - Bootstrap

In 2021 I participated in Nucamp's Full-Stack Bootcamp. In the first phase, we reviewed HTML and were taught how to design and build fully responsive websites with the Bootstrap framework. To enhance my learning of new topics, I created this simple meal-planning website built just with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

## Features
Nothing is functional, only the design and navbar are implemented 
- Home Page: Explains what the website is about
- Recipe Page: Here, users can view lists of all the recipes and add recipes
- Mealplan Page: Here, users can view the meal plan they created with the recipes
- Blog Page: Here, users can view and create posts

## Technology

- CSS
- Boostrap
- jQuery 
- Popper.js
